# Programming-and-Algorithm-TP
Lab assignments (travaux pratiques) for each practical class of Programming and Algorithm for Piyush Mishra. The course is taken by [Julien Lefebre](https://github.com/JulienLefevreMars) and practical sessions by [Jeremie Perrin](https://github.com/PerrinJeremie).


### TP1:
* Basic bash commands
* Basic python programming
* Git
### TP2 and TP3:
* Both in the folder for TP2. Python programming for Conway's game of life.
* Game of life implemented using numpy, rendered on pygame and visualised using matplotlib.
* For TP3, working of random, matplotlib and sys libraries.
### TP4:
* Sorting algorithms, comparison and analysis.
* Time complexity study of O(n^2) and O(nlgn) sorting functions (Bubble sort and Heap sort).
* Time complexity study of O(n) and O(lgn) searching functions (Sequential/Linear search and Binary/Dichotomous search).
* Comparing the times takenn to sort random arrays by heap sort, bubble sort and timsort (default python sort).
* *Optional Exercise*: General approach for sequence alignment using the largest common subsequence (dynamic programming) approach.
### TP5
* Implementing the Hamming Distance
* Implementing the Levenshtein Distance
* Sequence Alignment (using Largest Common Subsequence)
* Local Alignment (using Smith Waterman Algorithm, referred the internet as suggested, but followed by creating my own comprehensive code.
* *Optional Exercise*: Global Alignment (using the Needleman Wunsch algorithm)
